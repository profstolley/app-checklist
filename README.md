Technology Checklist

Students who have not successfully completed all of the items on this checklist by Friday, 22 January **must** withdraw from the course.

### Technology Essentials

- [x] Have a non-Windows operating system (OS X, Linux [could be virtualized]). If you choose to complete this course on a Windows computer, the instructor will not be able to help you with any tech issues beyond the contents of your projects' Git repositories.
- [x] If OS X, install XCode from the App Store and Homebrew with [these instructions](http://brew.sh/#install)
- [x] Set up Git on your computer (use Homebrew on OS X, Linux package manager, or compile from source)
- [x] Install a recommended text editor (TextWrangler, BBEdit, or Textmate on Mac; anything that handles Ruby syntax well on your Linux flavor)

### Git & GitHub Basics
- [x] Create a GitHub account
- [x] Create a new Git repo on your computer
- [x] Push the repo and paste its Web URL on GitHub here: (hope this is acceptable, it's one of my repositories from com530) https://github.com/thedanmartin/expanded-web-presence
- [x] On GitHub, fork the GitHub repository for the Technology Checklist
- [x] Clone your Technology Checklist fork to your computer
- [x] Create and checkout a branch with your name, e.g., `git checkout -b karl` (branch is "dpm")
- [x] Manipulate this `README.md` Markdown file & commit the changes
- [x] Push the changes you commit back up to GitHub until youâ€™ve completed the Technology Checklist

### Ruby & Rails Setup
- [x] Install Ruby 2 under RVM; run `ruby -v` and paste the output here:

ontime:app-checklist rachelrolland$ ruby -v
ruby 2.0.0p481 (2014-05-08 revision 45883) [universal.x86_64-darwin14]
ontime:app-checklist rachelrolland$

- [x] Install Rails 4 via `gem install rails`;

ontime:app-checklist rachelrolland$ gem install rails
Fetching: i18n-0.7.0.gem (100%)
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.
ontime:app-checklist rachelrolland$

^^^Does this mean it's already installed, or do I need to do some additional setup so I have permissions?

run `rails -v` and paste the output here:

ontime:app-checklist rachelrolland$ rails -v
Rails is not currently installed on this system. To get the latest version, simply type:

    $ sudo gem install rails

You can then rerun your "rails" command.
ontime:app-checklist rachelrolland$ sudo gem install rails
